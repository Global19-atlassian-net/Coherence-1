The packages.csv file lists all packages produced by the UniverseCoherence build. These are categorized by a few different criteria, and other parts of the build operate on those criteria.

Package: The name of the package

Category: The package shipping category
- noship: Internal infrastructure only. These will be uploaded to myget, but they won't get signed or uploaded to nuget.org.
- ship: Official product packages. These will be uploaded to myget, signed, and uploaded to nuget.org
- shipoob: Exceptions like Microsoft.AspNetCore.AzureAppServices.SiteExtension. These are official product packages that get uploaded to myget and signed but they do not ship to nuget.org, they ship via other distribution mechanisms. 

OptimizedCache: Should this package be included when we build an optimized package cache (e.g. shipping product assemblies only)
